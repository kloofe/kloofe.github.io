				<b>Description:</b> The game is based off of my freshman dorm hall. You play as someone from the hall and save the world from an alien invasion. We're hoping to have a working prototype by the end of March 2015 and have the game completed by June 2015.

				<b>My Contributions:</b> I'm working both as an artist and programmer. So far I've programmed level transitions, character controls, and game over.

				<b>Download:</b> No stable prototype yet
