				<b>Date:</b> January 2015
				<br><br>
				<b>Language:</b> C# (made in Unity)
				<br><br>
				<b>Description:</b> Play as Peter the anteater and avoid bicyclists and pedestrians as you make your way around ring road at UCI. Collect 3 ants to regain a life.
				<br><br>
				<b>My Contributions:</b> I did the art and animation and implemented them into the game. I also worked on programming the UI, player death/game over, and bug fixes. This was done for a game jam, and at the start of it, I was the only one with experience with Unity so I helped my team members get familiar with it, too.
