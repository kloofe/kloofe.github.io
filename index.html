			You hear the Name before you see it. The gentle murmuring caresses you while its distinct thrum matches the pulse of your throbbing ankle. Lifting your eyes, you look up through the tangle of broken branches leading up the hill. At the top, there is a small patch of air that lightly shimmers, twisting and somersaulting around itself in tune to the rhythmic thrumming. Most Names are mesmerizing but this one in particular suspends your attention for an unnaturally long time. Simply gazing at it makes you feel at peace and soothes the sharp pain in your ankle. You watch as the air dances along to its own song, telling the past, present, and future of a... You squint and look towards the center of the twirling air. A girl. It's telling the past, present, and future of a girl. As she kneels down to inspect the broken branches next to the path she is on, the translucent, wavering veil shifts in tune to her movements.

			Despite your distance, it is still obvious that this girl is gifted in the healing arts. Her Name reverberates with a tranquilizing power that makes you yearn for relief from the pain you are in, but you still hesitate calling out for her.

			<a href="/">♔ Leave her be. You have a feeling that you will turn out okay one way or another.</a><br>
